To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the recent service experience I had at your establishment. Despite having been a loyal customer for several years, my recent encounter left me with a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction.

The issues I encountered included lengthy wait times, unresponsive staff, and a general lack of attention to customer needs. I believe that a business of your caliber should strive for excellence in customer service, and my recent experience fell far short of that expectation.

I hope that my feedback serves as an opportunity for improvement in the way you serve your customers. While I have been a dedicated patron in the past, I am now reconsidering my continued support of your establishment.

I believe that constructive feedback is essential for any business to thrive, and I hope that my concerns are taken seriously and addressed promptly.

Sincerely,
