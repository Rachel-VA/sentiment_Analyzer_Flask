We love these little cars. Weâ€™ve had them almost a year now, and as our baby inches towards two we use them more and more. Most evenings after dinner we sit down and play cars. Love that they are wind up, soft, and perfect for little hands. The only grumble I have - of it can even be called that - is that some cars wind up and go farther than others! Otherwise, perfect. We even loved them so much we gifted a set, and they loved them too. Perfect first birthday gift. Or second. I agonized over buying them myself for my sons first birthday, but just do it, your little one will love them, and theyâ€™re so great to play with together for connecting time. The carrying bag and track arenâ€™t much to speak of but the cars themselves more than make up for it.
